  Hi! This is my professional blog where I intend to write on subjects that interest me about software development, education and learning and learning software development. Hope you find it useful!

Kudos to github for hosting this blog for free and also for the open source platform it was built with, created by one of their cofounders. Long live open source!

The jekyll project's pretty cool--you can check it out on [github](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (of course).
