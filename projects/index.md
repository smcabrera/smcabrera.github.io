## Open Source
On my github I have several open source projects, mainly tools to simplify common tasks.

### get_freaky
Wrapper for the confreaks API that permits browsing and downloading convention videos from the command line. Written as a ruby gem using the excellent commander and httparty gems for the command line interface and interacting with confreaks public api respectively. I write about this in greater detail in [this post](/get-freaky/)<br>

### dot_example
A command line tool for keeping configuration variables in sync across a team. Builds on using the dotenv gem and the convention of storing ENV variables in a `.env` file and automatically documents the changes in the keys for this file without the need for manual updating of a `.env.example` file. <br/>

### enter

###  dotfiles
The name smcabrera/dotfiles is already taken up by my fork of thoughtbot/dotfiles. They say a man's home is his castle; "Castillo" is Spanish for "castle", and this repo is my portable home directory that I've taken with me from machine to machine.<br>
