###  Blocitoff
A todo list application I wrote from scratch as part the [bloc](https://www.bloc.io) bootcamp. It has the additional feature that todos that you don't finish within a week self-destruct (via a rake task triggered by a cron job). Stop procrastinating!

###  Code Katas
Not really a project, this is a repo of coding exercises I use to practice everything from TDD to algorithms, refactoring to code review. I gave a talk about the utility of Code Katas at the March 2015 Ruby Peru meetup. Hopefully I'll get around to writing about this too.

###  castillo-cabrera
Not really a project either but still code worth sharing. This is my dotfiles repository--my castle (castillo = castle in spanish). I'm dangerously obsessed with my setup; hopefully someone will benefit benefit from my sharing them so I can feel a little better about all the time I've spent.
