### Get Freaky
Wrapper for the confreaks API that permits browsing and downloading convention videos from the command line. Written as a ruby gem using the excellent commander and httparty gems for the command line interface and interacting with confreaks public api respectively. I write about this in greater detail in [this post](/get-freaky/)<br>

###  Code Katas
Not really a project, this is a repo of coding exercises I use to practice everything from TDD to algorithms, refactoring to code review. I gave a talk about the utility of Code Katas at the March 2015 Ruby Peru meetup. Hopefully I'll get around to writing about this too.<br>

###  castillo-cabrera
Not really a project either but still code worth sharing. This is my dotfiles repository--my castle (castillo = castle in spanish). I'm dangerously obsessed with my setup; hopefully someone will benefit benefit from my sharing them so I can feel a little better about all the time I've spent.<br>
