<p>I&#39;ve recently been on the lookout for tools to make remote pair
programming easier. My main motivations are the following<br></p>

<ul>
<li>Pair programming, particularly with someone better than you (most
programmers at this point!) is the best way to learn</li>
<li>My goal is to work remotely as a developer so I want to get a good
comfortable remote setup.</li>
<li>I&#39;m currently engaged in an <a href="www.bloc.io">apprenticeship</a> heavily focused on remote
pair programming. So now it&#39;s urgent.</li>
</ul>

<p>So just recently I&#39;ve gotten much more aggressive at looking for quality
tools. I bought a book from the Pragmatic Bookshelf and I&#39;ve started
googling heavily. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found:</p>

<h3>tmux</h3>

<p>tmux is the clear winner for my current use case<br></p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Works great on linux</li>
<li>Works great with vim</li>
<li><em><em>low-bandwidth usage</em></em> This is huge.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Pair needs to be using a console editor like vim or emacs</li>
<li>Corllary to above--if you use vim and they use emacs, not so great</li>
<li>You may want to maniuplate the browser console together or do other
screen sharing that doesn&#39;t involve the console.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll have to find other solutions for when tmux isn&#39;t an option (screen sharing for when we want to look at what something looks like in a browser for instance) but I think that most of the time some kind of a tmux session solution is going to be the way to go (the prag programmers book also talks about different ways to do this).</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Basically you can set up a remote server and then you both connect to it via ssh. There&#39;s a pretty detailed description of the process <a href="http://www.zeespencer.com/articles/building-a-remote-pairing-setup/">here</a> using prgmr.com. There&#39;s this whole involved process for setting up your users, which he describes. There&#39;s a description of something similar in the book from a book on the topic from the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/jkrp/remote-pairing">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>.</p>

<h3>A Simpler Solution: tmate</h3>

<p><a href="http://tmate.io/">tmate</a>: A fork of tmux, designed to do the
above configuration automatically. As far as I can tell:</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Much easier setup--most of the work is already done for you.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>

<ul>
<li>The other person has to use your tmux configurations</li>
<li>You&#39;re stuck using ssh, instead of mosh (which is apparently faster than ssh).</li>
<li>I imagine, though I&#39;m not positive, that you wouldn&#39;t be able to use some of aforementioned tmux plugins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Tools to try out</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mosh.mit.edu/">mosh</a> SSH alternative. Uses less bandwidth and thus faster than ssh.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zolrath/wemux">wemux</a>: tmux plugin for remote</li>
<li>pairing--need to check it out and see what kind of features.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/benmills/vimux">vimux</a>: ditto.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a>: Looks like it
can be useful for saving a lot of settings (for a project) without
having to restart it each time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven&#39;t tried any of this yet, but I&#39;ll be giving these a shot and write about how it goes.</p>
