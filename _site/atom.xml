   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I officially begin my apprenticeship with &lt;a href=&quot;bloc.io&quot;&gt;Bloc&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m pretty excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Bloc? It&amp;#39;s an intensive course for learning the skills to be a professional web developer. Its part of a movement of companies designed to give people the professional skills to find employment in the tech industry via short but intensive study in immediately marketable skills, rather than the traditional multi-year degree-based educational model. Typically these programming &amp;quot;bootcamps&amp;quot; involve dropping $12,000 for three months of studying 40 to 50 hours a week in a classroom in major urban tech hub like San Francisco or New York. It sounds kind of crazy on the surface of it, but it seems to be working. There&amp;#39;s a huge demand for people with the skills these bootcamps are offering in a field where degrees matter less than ability and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile ever since the aborted start of my career in economic development I&amp;#39;ve been trying to forge a new career path studying online. I first fell in love with programming with a coursera course I took called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython&quot;&gt;Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python&lt;/a&gt; and the rest is history. But after a year of studying on my own, I finally decided that I&amp;#39;d like to do something more intensive and get a little more guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Bloc. Bloc takes this idea of intensive professional courses and moves them to the web. Instead of sitting in a classroom for 8 hours a day, the instruction takes place on an online platform. The human element takes place through the use of mentors--professional developers who dedicate time each week to meeting one-on-one with each of their students and providing some guidance for the process. The advantage of this setup is that I can do it right where I am now, from Lima Peru. This means a much lower cost both in terms of the cost of the program and in the costs of quitting my job and moving to an (expensive) North American city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suspect the mentor format might just be better than the traditional classroom format.  Learning, particularly learning development, takes place by doing. Compared to university education, thie teacher role in this setting seems less like a college lecturer and more like your thesis advisor--you meet periodically to go over your work and receive feedback and then you go back to your desk and work on your own. Being more independent and less structured is definitely challenging, but when I think back upon my experience in writing my senior thesis, I remember it as one of the times where I learned the most in all my time in college and was the most useful when applying for jobs. So I&amp;#39;m optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education and &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; generally are areas that interest me a great deal. I&amp;#39;m very excited to see the ways that technology can transform education, so I expect I&amp;#39;ll have quite a bit to comment on as I go through Bloc. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Heading This is a heading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing a paragraph here
It&amp;#39;s going to have several lines
(I&amp;#39;m just trying to play around with this theme and see what it looks like.
I suppose I&amp;#39;ll want to create a few more headings to see what those look like no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sub-heading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a level 2 heading
And a level 3 one...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;def methodname(arg)
  puts arg
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess this is an unordered list in markdown?
* Maybe it is
* It looks that way
* Yeah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And an ordered list like this I gather:
1. Item1
2. Item2
3. And finally item 3&lt;/p&gt;
