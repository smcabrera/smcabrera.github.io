I'm not a champ at regular expressions. But I used to be downright intimidated by them. I mean just looking at one when you're not used to is super intimidating by itself--it looks like complete giberish. Pretty soon though you realize they're important so it becomes something that you "really should learn at some point". And then don't.

<br>
I've found two ways of solving this problem. The first is that Steve Losh has a free book called *Regular Expressions the Hard Way*. You can work through the chapters gradually, maybe doing one every day so it seeps in slowly.

<br>
Perhaps an even better way to learn regular expressions is to just start writing them. This is what helped me to feel more confident with regular expressions. I was working on a code kata (an exercise from the excellent [exercism.io](exercism.io) platform) and realized that the problem I was working on would be a mess without a regex. After a bit of digging I found this tool [Rubular](www.rubular.com) which helps you test out regular expressions in the browser and has a reference at the bottom. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful this is. Being able to experiment and test things out I think is one of the best ways to learn anything, and it's a great way to learn regular expressions.

<br>
The next time you need to write a regular expression check out Rubular. It's meant for regular expressions in ruby, but they tend not to be super different between languages.
