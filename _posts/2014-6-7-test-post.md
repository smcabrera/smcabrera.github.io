## Heading This is a heading

I'm writing a paragraph here
It's going to have several lines
(I'm just trying to play around with this theme and see what it looks like.
I suppose I'll want to create a few more headings to see what those look like no?

### Sub-heading
This is a level 2 heading
And a level 3 one...

{% highlight ruby %}

def methodname(arg)
  puts arg
end

{% endhighlight %}

So I guess this is an unordered list in markdown?
* Maybe it is
* It looks that way
* Yeah

And an ordered list like this I gather:
1. Item1
2. Item2
3. And finally item 3
