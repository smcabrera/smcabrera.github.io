# What I'm looking for in my next gig

One silver lining of the very public nature of [the subsequent layoffs of the Fair San Francisco office](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/fair-the-softbank-backed-car-subscription-startup-lays-off-40-of-staff-sacks-cfo/) is that I can now be very open about my reasons for searching for a new position.

Doing a full time job search has given me a lot of practice to answering the question "what are you looking for in a new role?". To save everyone some time I thought I'd write about it here.

There are three main criteria I'm applying in my search, in ranked order of priority.

### Good location with remote flexibility
I travel regularly to see my partner, as she is completing her PhD. I generally work remotely at least a week every month, so a company with some flexibility around remote work is a must. I'm open to fully remote opportunities but it would also be great to be able to interact with colleagues in the Bay Area where I'm based. I live near the CalTrain and could probably commute as far away as Palo Alto for the right opportunity.

I have a wide range of experience with remote work and have learned a lot about how teams can do so effectively ([which I've written about here](http://fullstackalchemy.io/things-i-learned-working-on-remote-teams/)). I'd love to work for a company that is either already successful with remote work or has a culture that values communication, empathy and productivity that could allow it to be successful.

### Opportunity to leverage existing strengths while continuing to learn
I've been writing Ruby on Rails backends for the last five years in a range of environments and would love to provide technical leadership and mentorship based on the expertise I've developed. At the same time, I'd like to deepen my experience in areas where I've had less exposure.

Areas where I have particular interest and expertise include:
- Integrations with external APIs
- Developer tools (CLIs, scripts to simplify common tasks)
- Refactoring legacy codebases using SOLID principles
- Improving test suites making them more reliable, less flaky and less brittle (e.g. when and how to use mocks, [how to identify and eliminate intermittent test failures](http://fullstackalchemy.io/flaky-rspec-specs/), test coverage at different levels of a testing pyramid)

Areas that Iâ€™m interested in learning more include:
- Languages that are often tapped to replace ruby in contexts when performance is a concern (e.g. Elixir, Golang)
- Distributed systems problems (pub/sub, microservices, consistency)
- Component based frontend javascript frameworks like React or Vue

My ideal company would be one where I can be a mentor in areas like the first list and can be mentored in areas like the second list.

### Making an impact
[I worked in non-profits before getting into engineering](http://fullstackalchemy.io/about/). While it's not as important as the first two criteria I haven't given up hope for working to make an impact in something I can believe in.
