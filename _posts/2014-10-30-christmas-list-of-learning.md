When I was a kid, like many kids I made lists of stuff I really wanted and hoped I could get for Christmas. And while I'm not completely beyond that stage (I'd really love to get a folding bike that I could take with me on my travels!) the wish lists I make these days are things I want to *learn*. So for the sake of organizing my thinking a bit and sharing and/or getting back from the world, I give you my learning wish list, followed by *why* I want to learn each one and the resources. Hopefully this can be helpful to others and/or I can inspire people to share their own lists. I'd love to read them!

Here's my list *roughly* in order of priority/urgency):

- TDD in Rails
- Rails APIs
- Angular JS
- Design Patterns
- Node JS
- Command Line Application Development
- Grape/Cuba/other ruby microframework
- Servers / DevOps
- Algorithms
- Machine Learning
- Assembling Desktop Computers

Now the breakdown of the **why** and **how**.

### TDD in Rails

Testing is important. It just is. I've really drunk the cool-aid on this one from the many podcasts, and articles and blog posts and educational material and everything else, it's really sunk in. It's getting to the point where it's getting to be something as basic as version control. And unfortunately it's something that I've put off prioritizing other things. This needs to stuff.

Getting into the specifics of why it's so important is a post for another time, but I can say that if you listen to podcasts check out the ones from thoughtbot--testing is a topic they mention a lot. As far as resources for how to learn it, I'm already familiar with the basic idea and I've got Rspec basics down it's just a matter of being sure to dig up the documentation and have it at my side for the next project I do and make sure I do it full on TDD. I haven't tried it yet but Code School has a course on Testing in Rails that looks promising.

### Rails APIs
What with the increasing popularity of angularjs and other frontend frameworks, and mobile being really important it seems like everywhere I look there's somewhere a RESTful API can be plugged in and used as the backend for an application. It seems to me that as a Rails developer, knowing how to create well-structured APIs is a really important skill that's only going to become more important as time goes on. This is probably of equally high priority for me as TDD and one that I'm looking to work on as soon as possible. I've started on the Surviving APIs with rails course with Code School and it seems pretty solid so far, so I'm likely going to continue there.

### AngularJS
The tricky part about the proliferation of javascript frameworks is picking a winning horse. You don't want to spend lots of time learning a framework only to find out in a few years that no one's using it.  So how did I settle on Angular? Pretty much the same reason I picked rails--I was seeing lots of educational resources that looked good, and a community around them that seemed really positive. I've got a friend who's willing to look over my code. That's good enough criteria for me to give it a shot. Also as the proud new owner of a chromebook (more thoughts on that elsewhere) I'm interested in the direction google is taking application development.

As far as resources I'm looking into thinkster.io, with [this](https://thinkster.io/angulartutorial/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs/) introduction to AngularJS in particular because of its integration with their other courses on rails and MEAN stack. As part of the sort of "curriculum" they outline they suggest the screencasts at egghead.io which look really solid. Code school also has a basic (and free!) introduction to AngularJS [here](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js).

Well, I don't have time to get into all of them right now, but that's a good start. Hopefully I can come back later and flesh out this list. I'd be interested to hear what's on other people's learning wish list and why.
