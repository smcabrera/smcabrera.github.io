Recently I was talking to someone who was interested in getting into tech and was considering enrolling in a local college. I strongly advised against this and recommended instead that he opt for something closer to what I did; a non-traditional education in modern open-source technologies for Web Development. Having done this and having explored many options I have a lot to say on the matter and wasn't able to summarize everything I thought all at once. Here is that summary.

## The problem with Traditional Education
I too considered going the traditional educational route, thinking about going back to school to do a graduate program in statistics so I could work as a data scientist. Honestly, I'm still not sure that would have been a horrible idea. What disuaded me from doing so was mostly the time and the money associated with a graduate program. I wasn't *totally* sure that this was what I wanted to do and I wasn't about to spend so much time and money for something that I thought I might like.

There are however lots of free or low-cost online resources that can help you get an introduction to programming. I think these are probably the best way to start as they allow you to test the waters before you make a bigger commitment to something like a coding bootcamp (more on those in a minute). Here are the free or low cost resources that I've been able to find.

- Code School:
- Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial:
- Udacity:
- Coursera:
- EdX:

## Coding Bootcamps
One newer resource in the technical education space is the Coding Bootcamp. There is no one standard for what a coding bootcamp is but they all generally revolve around the idea of an intensive three to six month program training people in the practical skills needed to get a job as a junior developer.

Many people have come across a coding bootcamp or two and don't realize that it is far from their only option for learning web development--there's actually a *ton* of them now. [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/) is a comprehensive guide to coding bootcamps all over the world, providing information on the different technologies they teach, teaching methodologies, locations, job placement and pricing.


## Online bootcamps
The traditional bootcamp that you'll find listed on Course Report is in person, costs around $10k and requires you to live in a big expensive city in the U.S. This turns into a LOT of money at the end of the day and it can be really hard to get your hands on that much money in the first place, especially if you've got student debt.

Having studied online I will say it's a lot harder to stay focused all the time when you're *mostly* just working in isolation than if you go to an in-person bootcamp. I don't think I put nearly the same amount of hours into the program as I would have if I was trapped 12 hours a day somewhere doing nothing but eat, sleep and dream code.

## Bloc
The course that I took was a course called bloc.io It's a really solid course, I've gotten a lot out of it and the currciulum has improved a lot just in the time I've taken it. If you do decide to go with this one you can get a $100 off and I can earn $100 if you use this link to sign up: https://www.bloc.io/?ref_token=MTI4MTY3Mg

That said, I think if I were doing this over again that's actually not the one I'd go with.

## Viking Code School
If I were going to do an online code school I think this is the one I would go with. For two reasons:

1. Group classes
2. Deferred tuition

Check out this line from their website:

We are 100% incentivized to get you the most successful software engineering job possible... We do not charge tuition. Instead, you pay a fee equal to 18% of your first year's salary when you get a job.

I heard about this when they first started offering it and I thought it was incredible. They are essentially putting their money where their mouth is and betting that 

Now, keep in mind, that rate could very well make the program than, bloc, the course I took. I paid $5000 grand upfront and was able to get a scholarship for $500 for belonging to a demographic that's under-represented among software developers, bringing the cost down to $4500. By contrast, the average salary for a junior Ruby on Rails Developer is around $76k or so. Even if you made $10k less than you're still looking at paying $12k in that first year of working.

That said, if you're in a situation where you're nervous about the prospect of shelling out five grand, I think the idea that someone else is willing to make that investment could make you more than willing to let them reap the rewards for having faith in you. It's really a pretty extraordinary deal and I wish more educational institutions made bets on their students like that.


Also here's a link to The Odin Project, which is essentially the free do-it-yourself companion to Viking Code School I think this is basically the curriculum they use, and that Viking Code School is essentially a higher touch version of this program (support from your cohort and the course staff)

Another important consideration with an online course is job placement. Make no mistake you will learn lots of practical web development stuff with a good remote program. However, in person bootcamps typically offer a job fair or something similar, often working as headhunters of sorts with partners in the region. With a remote bootcamp you don't have a job fair at the end and they can't even guarantee that there are jobs in your area; you might find that you need to move to find a gig.

In general, the sorts of technologies that these bootcamps focus on tend to be modern open-source software stacks like Ruby on Rails (probably still the most popular) Python with the Django framework, or one of the new Javascript frameworks like Node.js for the backend and Angular JS for the frontend. These are great technologies and learning them well will equip you to work with a modern software stack and learn the latest best practices. However, in smaller markets like Cleveland, the job market does still seem to be dominated (if not actually exclusively) by more mainstream technologies like PHP and Java as well as a heavy Microsoft-focused ecosystem (.net, C#)

An in person program is generally way more expensive though and generally require you to move to one of the most expensive cities in the United States if you don't already live in one--a pretty intimidating prospect.
