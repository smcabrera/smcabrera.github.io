## How I got here
### Working for non-profits
In college my goal was to work in international development. I majored in economics, studied abroad in Argentina for a year and wrote an honor’s thesis on the effect of economic crises on skilled migrants to the United States. After graduation I joined AmeriCorps for a year, training and managing a team of volunteers at tax preparation sites and providing organizational support for the local coalition of such sites. In 2011, I moved to Peru to work as a field researcher doing research with a non-profit Microfinance Institution  and an early childhood education program. I trained and led teams of surveyors, designed survey instruments, and cleaned/analyzed the resulting data.

### Discovering Programming
Considering doing graduate work in economics I took the GRE and took advantage of the advent of Massively Open Online Courses to prepare myself with classes on Data Analysis, calculus, linear algebra and python programming. Once I started learning programming  I was hooked, and discovered I could work remotely and have the freedom to live where I wanted while still making a difference in the world .

I took online courses in web development while while teaching English and  working in the marketing department of a travel agency. Eventually I learned enough to take on web responsibilities in my job at a travel agency doing tasks like automating the writing of SEO text with python scripts or creating a custom google analytics solution to improve tracking for sales.

I wanted to go deeper into programming, so I enrolled in an online web development apprenticeship through [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io). In the summer of 2015 I moved back to the U.S. and have been freelancing for clients all over the country since then. I’ve worked mainly with startups as a ruby on rails developer, working on web backends and APIs.

### Freelancing
Throughout my team freelancing I’ve worked for several clients, all startups with geographically distributed teams.  Here are some of the things I’ve worked on:

- Built features for the beta launch of a peer to peer insurance network using Ruby on Rails and React.
- Built features for both the hotel and planner sides of a booking engine and request for proposal management system, keeping data between these applications in sync through their respective  APIs
- Refactoring and performance tuning of CSV exports for an administrative site.
- Created messaging systems for routing emails to and from user's personal email accounts .

I try to continue to devote to learning new technologies and building [personal projects](/projects/) as well.
