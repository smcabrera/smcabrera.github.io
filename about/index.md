## Full Stack Alchemy
 My attempt at slowly building a tiny consulting company. So far my focus on doing ruby on rails development for early stage startups.

## How I got here

I took a pretty winding road to software development. Back in 2011 I moved to the Peruvian highlands to work for an NGO as a research assistant. Deciding that wasn't for me, I decided to quit my job and explore other possibilities while teaching English in Peru. After a year of taking online courses on everything from linear algebra and data analysis to Ancient Greek History and python programming, I decided to dedicate myself to learning programming. Eventually I learned enough to take on web responsibilities in my job at a travel agency doing tasks like automating the writing of SEO text with python scripts or creating a little hack for a custom google analytics solution to improve tracking for sales.<br>
I wanted to step up my game so I enrolled in an online web development apprenticeship through [bloc](https://www.bloc.io). I moved back to the U.S. in the summer of of 2015 and have been freelancing for clients all over the country since then.

## What I'm up to now
Right now I'm working as a freelancer using Ruby on Rails. I try to continue to devote time to learning new technologies and building [personal projects](/projects/) as well.
