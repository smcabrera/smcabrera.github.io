I'm an American expat living in Peru where I moved three years ago to work as a research assistant. A year in I decided to quit my job, and use the power of the internet to explore new possibilities while remaining in Peru. I discovered that I loved programming, and so after a year of taking online courses and tutorials I decided to devote myself full time to building a career in web development. Now, I'm enrolled in an intensive ruby on rails course and working part time for a former employer supporting the development of an application built on php5 and the laravel framework. My goal is to work as a ruby on rails developer on a distributed team and continue doing what I love while exploring the world.
