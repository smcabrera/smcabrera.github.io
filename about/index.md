### From non-profits…
In college my goal was to work in international development. I majored in economics, studied abroad in Argentina for a year and wrote an honor’s thesis on the effect of economic crises on skilled migrants to the United States. After graduation I joined AmeriCorps for a year, training and managing a team of volunteers at tax preparation sites and providing organizational support for the local coalition of such sites. In 2011, I moved to Peru to work as a field researcher doing research with a non-profit Microfinance Institution  and an early childhood education program. I trained and led teams of surveyors, designed survey instruments, and cleaned/analyzed the resulting data.

### ...to discovering programming…
Considering doing graduate work in economics I took the GRE and took advantage of the advent of Massively Open Online Courses to prepare myself with classes on Data Analysis, calculus, linear algebra and python programming. Once I started learning programming  I was hooked, and discovered I could work remotely and have the freedom to live where I wanted while still making a difference in the world .

I took online courses in web development while while teaching English and  working in the marketing department of a travel agency. Eventually I learned enough to take on web responsibilities in my job at a travel agency doing tasks like automating the writing of SEO text with python scripts or creating a custom google analytics solution to improve tracking for sales.

I wanted to go deeper into programming, so I enrolled in an online web development apprenticeship through [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io) where I put went beyond the LAMP stack education I had pieced together and small scripts I had written and learned how to test drive writing complex database backed web applications with ruby on rails.

### ...to building companies
In the summer of 2015 I moved back to the U.S. and have been freelancing for startups all over the country since then. I’ve worked mainly with startups as a ruby on rails developer, working up and down the stack but mainly on web backends and APIs. I’ve worked for several clients, all startups with geographically distributed teams.

You can see find out more about my client work in [projects](/projects).

When I'm not working on client work I'm studying ruby and rails resources to deepen my expertise and learning new skills like react and elixir to complement my rails toolset. I've also built some open source tools to simplify some common tasks which I've open sourced and can be found [here](/projects/) or [on my github](https://www.github.com/smcabrera).

### To the city by the bay
In early 2017 I moved to the San Francisco bay area to work for Bright Funds, a startup with the ambitious goal of changing the way that people donate to charitable causes they care about.
