My name's Stephen Mariano. I go by Stephen in North America and Mariano in South America. Take your pick. 

<br>
Right now I'm based out of my hometown of sunny Cleveland, Ohio. I love writing, learning and [building things](/projects/). Right now I'm building things with Ruby. I hope to use this site to share some of that love.
<br>

## How I got here

I took a pretty winding road into web development. Back in 2011 I moved to the Peruvian highlands to work for an NGO as a research assistant. A year in I decided to quit my job and explore other possibilities while teaching English in Peru. After a year of taking online courses on everything from linear algebra and data analysis to Ancient Greek History and python programming, I decided to dedicate myself to learning web development. Eventually I learned enough to take on web responsibilities in my current job doing tasks like automating the writing of SEO text with python scripts or creating a little hack for a custom google analytics solution to improve tracking for sales. 
<br><br>
I wanted to do this full time though and I wanted to learn more than I was likely going to get a chance to doing what I was doing so I enrolled in an online web development apprenticeship with [bloc](https://www.bloc.io).

## What I'm up to now
Right now I'm working as a freelancer using Ruby on Rails but I'm open to other projects with other interesting technologies. Right now my main priority is getting great experience with interesting projects and technologies. I try to devote time to learning new technologies and building [personal projects](/projects/) as well.
