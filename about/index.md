My name's Stephen Mariano. I go by Stephen in North America and Mariano in South America. Take your pick. <br>
Right now I'm based out of my hometown of sunny Cleveland, Ohio. I love writing, learning and [building things](/projects/). Right now I'm building things with Ruby. I hope to use this site to share some of that love.

## How I got here

I took a pretty winding road to web development. Back in 2011 I moved to the Peruvian highlands to work for an NGO as a research assistant. A year in I decided to quit my job and explore other possibilities while teaching English in Peru. After a year of taking online courses on everything from linear algebra and data analysis to Ancient Greek History and python programming, I decided to dedicate myself to learning web development. Eventually I learned enough to take on web responsibilities in my current job doing tasks like automating the writing of SEO text with python scripts or creating a little hack for a custom google analytics solution to improve tracking for sales.<br>
I wanted to step up my game so I enrolled in an online web development apprenticeship through [bloc](https://www.bloc.io). Finally, I moved back to my hometown of Cleveland in the summer of 2015 to seek out new opportunities.

## What I'm up to now
Right now I'm working as a freelancer using Ruby on Rails but I'm open to other projects with interesting technologies--I want go learn as much as I can and work with interesting projects and technologies. I try to continue to devote time to learning new technologies and building [personal projects](/projects/) as well.
