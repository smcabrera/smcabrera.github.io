I'm an American expat living in Peru where I moved three years ago to work as a research assistant. A year in I decided to quit that job, but remain in the country while I explored other options. After a year taking online courses and tutorials I discovered my current passion: programming. Since then I've been trying to make the shift into web development, from taking courses remotely to shifting my responsibilities in my job so I could learn and practice new skills. My goal is to work as a ruby on rails developer for a company with a distributed team and continue to explore the world while doing what I love.
